        <h2>Meet Ansh: The YOLO Kid</h2>
        <p>
            People know him as a guy who never misses a deadline. Or a class. Or a question in the exam. The perfect student, son, and friend.
            Has never done anything illegal in his whole life.

        <h2>Meet Nauman: The Paranoid Kid</h2>
        <p>
            Everything scares him. If you watch a horror movie with him for five minutes you need to accompany him to the bathroom for the next 2 days.
            If there is one thing in the world he hates, that's germs and microbes. Rumors have it he has never been sick in his life.

        <h2>The Latest: Tokyo's Daily Infections Top 600 for First Time</h2>
        <p>TOKYO — The number of new coronavirus infections in Japan's capital have topped 600 in a day for the first time.

            Experts on Tokyo's virus task force say the surge in infections has placed an added burden on hospitals, making it difficult for many of them to carry out treatment for ordinary patients.
            
            Tokyo reported 602 new cases Thursday, while the daily tally for the entire nation was 2,810. Japan has reported 168,573 infections since the pandemic began, with 2,465 deaths.
            
            Tokyo Gov. Yuriko Koike is urging residents to avoid non-essential outings, especially senior citizens and their families. Tokyo has issued a request for drinking places to close early until Dec. 17.

        <h2>India's Pandemic Recovery Plan Could Cost Air Quality Goals</h2>
        <p>
            NEW DELHI (AP) — India is facing two public health emergencies simultaneously: critically polluted air and the pandemic. And Surinder Singh, a bus driver in the capital New Delhi, is trapped between them both.

In previous years, the government encouraged more people to use buses that run on cleaner fuels, like the one he drives, as an emergency air quality measure. But this year there are limits on passengers to maintain social distance. The air stings Singh's eyes and he worries about contracting the virus every time a person gets on board.

Still reeling from India’s harsh lockdown that dried up his $9 daily income for two months, the 47-year-old father of two says he has no choice but to work. Masked and armed with a bottle of hand sanitizer, he starts his journey near a private hospital that is overwhelmed by virus patients. He travels through roads packed with traffic to the city’s largest and most frenetic railway station.

“I drive the bus in constant fear," he said.

Millions of others are equally desperate in India's historic recession. The economy contracted by 23.9% in the April-June quarter — its worst performance in at least 24 years — and by 7.5% in the next quarter.

        <h2>Meet Yoki: The Kid With the Hero Syndrome</h2>
        <p>
            She was raised believing she would be a hero one day. You are chased by a stalker? She is the detective. You lost your wallet?
            She will throw herlself under a train or beyond to retrieve it. She holds a strong belief that the world will need her one day.
            And that she will be hero we need, but not one we deserve.

        <h2>Meet Maryam: The Rich Kid</h2>
        <p>
            Very comfortable single kid with a lot of connections and power. You are a friend of hers and need that visa to travel for your winter break
            but the logistics are too complicated? She makes one call. People look up to her. She normally looks down on them. If a ship is sinking she
            will be one of the first people who will be saved by the emergency units. Not your typical favorite kid.

        <h2>Migrant Caravan Sets off to U.S. From Honduras, Risking New Tensions</h2>
        <p>
            SAN PEDRO SULA, Honduras (Reuters) - A few hundred Hondurans formed a caravan bound for the United States on Wednesday after hurricanes battered the country, posing a fresh challenge to efforts to stem illegal immigration from Central America on the cusp of a new U.S. administration.

Mostly younger migrants with backpacks and some women carrying children left the northern city of San Pedro Sula on foot for the Guatemalan border after calls went out on social media to organize a caravan to the United States.

If the exodus grows, it could become the first major caravan to hit the road since Joe Biden defeated U.S. President Donald Trump in a presidential election last month.

Striking just two weeks apart in November, Hurricanes Eta and Iota hammered infrastructure, homes and crops, killing about 100 people in Honduras. The neighboring countries of Guatemala and Nicaragua also suffered widespread damage.

        <h2>The Face-Mask Seat: a South Korean Student's Attempt to Recycle in COVID Times</h2>
        <p>
            UIWANG, South Korea (Reuters) - How many disposable masks does it take to make a stool?

Kim Ha-neul knows it takes 1,500.

Bothered by the waste caused by disposable face masks, many of which are made of polypropylene, the South Korean furniture design student has come up with an eco-friendly solution, melting them to make stools he calls "Stack and Stack".

"Plastic is recyclable, so why don't we recycle face masks, which are made of plastic?" the 23-year-old said.

In June, Kim set up a mask collection box at his school, the Kaywon University of Art and Design in Uiwang city, south of Seoul. He has since gathered 10,000 used masks, and has received more than a tonne of defective ones from a factory as well.
